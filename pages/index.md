## Create Anywhere Publish Everywhere

"Anywhere" is a content repository. A content repository is anything that contains a set of content. Examples are twitter, facebook, flickr, dropbox markdown files, hell even drupal or wordpress. "Everywhere" is focused on personalized/custom website hosted on supersimple, but could really be anything… No more web "pages". Just content "views". All content is exposed in a read-only "API" making it available to any device that can consume it.

CAPE also uses the first 3 features, plus a different type of Dropbox integration focusing on content)
and when you add CAPE [the ability to pull in content from various content repositories --> Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, Dropbox (w/ Markdown files)…].
This means that, for example, WATCH would have 2 line items for hosting:
--> SuperSimple (the hosting)
--> CAPE (access to the content features and system overall)
