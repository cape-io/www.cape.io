## There is a service for that

Wordpress has "plugins". Drupal has "modules". iPhones have "apps". The Internet has services. Regardless of the CMS (Drupal, Wordpress or otherwise) third party services are used on almost every website published today. One of the most common services is Google Analytics, it monitors and tracks user activity on the site. Drupal has a statistics module but it's limited to counting the views of each page. Google Analytics is so much better that hardly anyone uses the built in statistics module anymore.

When a website needs to send out newsletters we setup a service like MailChimp, Campaign Monitor or Constant Contact. These services are upgraded automatically and transparently and have little or no effect on other discrete features of the website. Using third party providers for very discrete features enables the developer to focus on the core set of functionality that makes the site unique and valuable.

As we build out a website we will use the best tool or service for the feature required. If the feature is something simple that a proven third party tool can do better than we ever could, we'll be sure to use that. If it's something more complicated that requires some customization we'll build something that fits.

We aren't against using Drupal, nor are we suggesting to only use third party services. We just want to build the most robust, fault tolerant website as efficiently as possible. End users will stay on your site the entire time. Administrators however may need to login to certain websites to view and manage certain things. Site analytics and reports will be available the the Google Analytics website.

Events will be stored in a database and be editable, sortable, and searchable. We will maintain the ability export the events to Quark and likely gain a few other options in the process. It's very likely we will have a custom admin interface to help manage events.

We will have a development site with a different address that we will use for testing and approval. During the process we will migrate existing users to the new website. When we are ready to go live we will make a setting change on the domain name and users will begin to see the new site. There won't be any downtime.
