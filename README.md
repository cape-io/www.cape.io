## Create Anywhere, Publish Everywhere.

The way the contemporary web works is increasingly about linking together disparate and specialized services; not providing a single website with all solutions pre-built or hardwired into the site itself. CAPE accepts and embraces this new ecosystem.

CAPE uses existing and (mostly) standard formatting, hardware, software, and server technologies. However, the way in which these things are combined is fairly novel.

_This is software, service, and philosophy in one._

As software, CAPE provides a backend to control content — photos from Flickr or Instagram; documents from Dropbox, Google Drive, or Github; items from an inventory management system; Facebook Posts, Wordpress posts, content from your existing website — basically anything accessible via API, anything in an RSS feed, and anything otherwise publishable to the web (cloud) in a common data format (XML, JSON, TXT, etc.).

As a service, CAPE is a cog that lives in the cloud and connects to other cloud cogs. A service for connecting your services. Pick the existing products, softwares, services, etc. that are already comfortable, that already manage different kinds of content — workflow tools, photo services, etc. — and then use what you are already familiar with to create and edit the content for your website, app, or even a print application.

Philosophically, CAPE is about rethinking content creation and management. It is best to approach content creation in as "pure" a way as possible (meaning semantic, structural, meta-data rich content — not styled content). This makes it easy then for CAPE to always map content from one place to another and easily template it for whatever use required.

The "Back-end" of a CAPE site is fluid. It will be different depending on the needs and requirements of the project. Some sites or apps may have no visible backend at all, merely being made up of a CAPE listener that just generates new content when new content shows up elsewhere without the site or app owners needing to do anything.

LORN — Linux, OpenResty, RethinkDB, and Node.js

We are currently rolling CAPE out on several sites and proof-of-concept services. We look forward to showing you more soon.
